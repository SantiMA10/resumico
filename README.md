## Google Cloud

As today, the project is designed to be deployed on GCP since it makes use of several of its services.

## App Engine Standard

We use the nodejs environment in [App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/runtime) since it has a great free tier (26 hours) and ffmpeg installed.

### Speech to Text

We use it to transcribe the audio files. 

In order to make it work you need:

1. The [Speech to Text api](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/speech.googleapis.com) enabled.
2. A service account with access to the Speech to Text api in the a file with the path set in `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. [More information](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAC)

### Storage bucket

To store the files and that the Speech to Text api can read them.

In order to make it work you need:

1. A GCS bucket, you need to set the name in the `GCLOUD_BUCKET` env var.
2. A service account with access to the bucket.

### Tasks

To handle the requests to the audio2summary endpoint, since we need to respond as fast as we can to WhatApp's webhook.

1. A Google Cloud Tasks queue, configure to run task to your App Engine service.
   1. Add the queue name, location and project in the following env vars: `GCLOUD_TASK_QUEUE`, `GCLOUD_LOCATION` and `GCLOUD_PROJECT`.
2. A service account with access to the Google Cloud Tasks queue.
